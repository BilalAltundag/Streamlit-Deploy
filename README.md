# Streamlit-Deploy

Veri Seti = https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries

In the data set, there is information such as the annual salaries of the people who are engaged in data science and in which country they work.

Our aim is to analyze data through this information and deploy our project via Streamlit.

First, we create a file called **app.py** and write our streamlit code.

Then we create a file called **requirements.txt** and write the names of the libraries you created in the **app.py** python code.

Finally, we add the necessary additional files to our github repository.

When these processes are finished, we go to https://streamlit.io/cloud and create an account if you do not have an account. We click on create a **new app** and select the repository we uploaded on github and deploy it.

Congratulations, you now have a simple website that users can access over the internet!
